Verification
------------
This document outlines the verification plan of the Esparducam v1 board.


No shorts found
 - checked VCC/GND
 - checked all ESP pins


Verification plan
 - Verify power - check
 - Barrel polarity - check
 - Regulator output (U1) - check
 - Verify mosfet power supply for ArduCAM module (Q1) - check
 - Produce a board with
    C1 C2
    R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6
    SPI flash
    Q1
    U1


Issues found
 - Footprint/silkscreen mismatch for the barrel connector.
 - Swapped RX/TX on the FTDI connector. Need to make a special cable, swap yellow and orange.
 - NCP1117 GND pin not directly routed to GND plane.
 - ArduCAM Mini has a pullup on its CS pin which is connected to GPIO15. The ESP will not boot with the ACAM module attached. Fix is to move CAM_CS to GPIO4.
 - One of the ESP modules had a broken Wifi antenna. Need a way to verify modules prior to mounting.
 - FTDI connector silk is ugly
 - Wrong footprint for Q1, selected SOT-323 instead of SOT-23. Luckily solder will make a '23 sit on the '323 pads :)

Planned changes for v2
 + Fix footprint of barrel connector.
 + Fix swapped UART RX/TX pins.
 + Fix FTDI connector silk.
 + Add label "Flash" under the SPI flash.
 + Replace BOOT label with FLASH.
 + Replace N-mosfet with a P-mosfet cutting power on the high side (check Harizanov's Funky with RFM12).
 + Move CAM_CS to GPIO 4.
 + Move CAM_PWR to GPIO 15.
 + NCP1117 GND pin not directly routed to GND plane.
 + Move SJ1 to the back side
 + Skip SJ2
 + Add protective diode with SJ bypass
 + Place 0.1uF, 1uF & 10uF close to ESP VCC
 + Add label for flash size under the board in the same manner as the "ESP type" label.
 + Change footprint for Q1 to SOT-23
